## Multiprogramming Operating System Simulation
Overview
This repository contains a simulation of a multiprogramming operating system implemented in C++. The OS handles various jobs, manages errors like time limit exceeded, line limit exceeded, and stores data in virtual memory using segmentation. This project serves as a simulation of an operating system environment.

## Features
Multiprogramming: The OS supports the execution of multiple programs concurrently.
Job Management: Handles various jobs and processes.
Error Handling: Manages errors such as time limit exceeded, line limit exceeded, etc.
Virtual Memory: Stores data in virtual memory using segmentation.
Usage
Ensure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed.

## Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Kartik-Katkar/Multiprogramming-Operating-System.git
cd Multiprogramming-Operating-System
